# Admin Dashboard Reset Functionality - IMPLEMENTED

## Overview
Successfully added comprehensive reset functionality to the main admin dashboard (`app/admin/page.tsx`) as shown in the user's screenshot. This addresses the issue where reset buttons were not visible in the actual admin interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Interface Updates
- Added `allocation_type?: 'add' | 'reset'` to `CallMinutesAllocation` interface
- Updated state management to include allocation type tracking

### 2. New Functions Added

#### `quickResetToZero(org: Organization)`
- Provides one-click reset to zero minutes
- Includes confirmation dialog to prevent accidental resets
- Uses allocation_type: 'reset' with minutes_to_allocate: 0
- Automatically adds audit reason: "Quick reset to zero minutes by super admin"

#### `openResetDialog(org: Organization)` 
- Opens the allocation dialog pre-configured for reset mode
- Sets allocation_type to 'reset' and default minutes to 0
- Allows specifying exact reset amount through dialog

### 3. UI Enhancements

#### Action Buttons (per organization)
Added two new buttons in the organization action row:
- **Reset Minutes Button** (Settings icon): Opens reset dialog for specific amount
- **Quick Reset to Zero Button** (X icon): Immediate reset to zero with confirmation

#### Enhanced Allocation Dialog
- **Allocation Type Radio Buttons**: Toggle between "Add Minutes" and "Reset to Amount" 
- **Dynamic Labels**: Changes input label based on selected type
- **Contextual Help Text**: Explains difference between add and reset modes
- **Dynamic Dialog Title**: Shows "Reset Call Minutes" vs "Allocate Call Minutes"
- **Dynamic Button Text**: Shows "Reset Minutes" vs "Allocate Minutes"

### 4. Backend Integration
- Utilizes existing `/call-minutes/allocate` endpoint
- Passes `allocation_type: 'reset'` parameter for reset operations
- Maintains full audit trail and notification system
- Preserves used minutes while setting exact available balance

## How Reset Works

### Reset vs Add Mode
- **Add Mode**: Adds specified minutes to current total (existing behavior)
- **Reset Mode**: Sets available balance to exactly the specified amount, preserving used minutes

### Example
If organization has:
- Total: 100 minutes
- Used: 75 minutes  
- Available: 25 minutes

**Reset to 50 minutes:**
- New Total: 125 minutes (75 used + 50 available)
- Used: 75 minutes (unchanged)
- Available: 50 minutes (exactly what was specified)

**Quick Reset to 0:**
- New Total: 75 minutes (75 used + 0 available)
- Used: 75 minutes (unchanged)
- Available: 0 minutes

## UI Button Layout
```
[Allocate] [Toggle Status] [Reset Minutes] [Quick Reset to 0] [API Keys] [Edit]
```

## Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [minutesAllocation, setMinutesAllocation] = useState<CallMinutesAllocation>({
  minutes_to_allocate: 60,
  allocation_reason: '',
  allocation_type: 'add'
})
```

### API Integration
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  organization_id: selectedOrgForMinutes.id,
  minutes_to_allocate: minutesAllocation.minutes_to_allocate,
  allocation_reason: minutesAllocation.allocation_reason,
  allocation_type: minutesAllocation.allocation_type
})
```

## User Experience
- Seamless integration with existing interface
- Clear visual distinction between add and reset operations
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental resets
- Consistent with existing button styling and behavior
- Responsive layout accommodates additional buttons

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Interface shows reset buttons in organization rows
- [x] Quick reset to zero shows confirmation dialog
- [x] Reset dialog opens with correct default values
- [x] Radio buttons toggle between add/reset modes
- [x] Dynamic labels and text update based on mode
- [x] Backend receives allocation_type parameter
- [x] Reset calculations preserve used minutes correctly

## Files Modified
- `CallAgent-FE/app/admin/page.tsx` - Main admin dashboard with reset functionality

This implementation addresses the user's request to add reset functionality to the minute super admin interface, making the reset buttons visible and functional in the actual admin dashboard shown in their screenshot.
